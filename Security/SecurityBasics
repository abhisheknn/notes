Protect againt what ?  
1 .Unauthorized Modification.      
2. Unauthorised Access.   
3. Unauthorized Deletion. 

CIA Traids :
 1. Confidentiality 
 2. Integrity 
 3. Availability


Steps to fix the Issue /Crime :  
 1. Identify    
 2. Analyze and evalute   
 3. Threat   
 
  
Vulnerablity :  weakness in system / Bug in software   
Threat :   Natural , intentional Threats, unintentional Threat   
Risk :  1. potential for loss or damage when threat exploits a vulnerability  
        2. Threat X Vulnerablity

openssl 

To generate Private Key:
openssl genrsa -aes128  -out privatekey 4096

To Generate Public Key 
openssl rsa -in privatekey -pubout -out publickey

To Encrypt the message/file :
openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey publickey  -in input.txt -out encypted.txt

To Decrypt the file :
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey privatekey -in encypted.txt -out plain.txt


Certificates :
What are certificates ?
What is the diffrence between SSL and TLS ?
What are the version of TLS ?

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365


Hashing :

MD5 : md5sum 
SHA 

Passwords are stored as sha


You might know that SSL/TLS certificates work on public key infrastructure (PKI). 
It means that they’re issued by authorized entities known as “certificate authorities.” 
A certificate authority is supposed to sign an SSL certificate when it issues it, to make it legitimate. 
Here, a certificate authority signs the hash of the certificate rather than the entire certificate, as it’s much more convenient. 
This signature works as a cryptographic proof that a trusted certificate authority issues the certificate, and nobody has tampered with it.

As the certificate has been converted into a hash, the smallest of change in it will cause the entire hash to change. 
This, in turn, will cause the signature to change. The browser will compare this changed signature to the original signature 
and will terminate the certificate as invalid.

Thus, hashing algorithms carry the responsibility of legitimizing an SSL certificate.
