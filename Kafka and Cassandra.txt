Kafka Uses sendfile : https://developer.ibm.com/articles/j-zerocopy/
Use batch compression
push vs pull ?

How at most once works in kafka ?
How at least once workes in kafka ?
How exactly once works in kafka ?
How replication works in kafka ?

How to achive multi tenancy in kafka ?

What is topic ?
How data in a stored in topic ?
What is log in kafka?
Explain the kafka as messaging system ?
What is log compaction ?
	ensures that log contains at least the last known value of for specific key 
	If you want to get database like feature not stream
	All the current consumer don`t get to see the updated results ,
	All the new comsuers will see only on key 
	Does not change offset 
	Deleted records can be seen by consumer delete.retention.ms default 24 
	
How Transaction works in kafka ?
       1) consumer and producer and streams should have the "transaction.id" as part of config 
       2) .initTransactions();
       3) .beginTransaction();
       4) .commitTransaction();
      
    Consumer should have isolation.level as read.commited   
    transaction-cordinator and transaction log (Internal kafka topic)
    Uses 2phase commit . 
    There should be only one producer with tranaction id .

What is Exactly once in kafka ?    https://hevodata.com/blog/kafka-exactly-once/
Data processing on message happens exactly once 
Pushing the message to kafka happns exactly once.
How Producers achive it ?
When producr starts PID gets assigned to producer and a seq no which .
When producer sends the msg to kafka , kafka veries the producer and seq no .
The seq no is incremented sequentialy , is excalty one number greater than prev seq no .
If the network failuer happens and ask producer to send the same msg again kafka will send the same msg with same seq no .
As kafka knows that msg with this seq no is already consumed it will discard the msg.
Producers PID gets changed if producer restarts . so Idempotency promised for excatly once producer session .
Property :

How Consumers dose it ?

How Stream does it ?

What is diffrence between GlobalKTable and KTable ?
KTable is sharded across all running instance of Ktable .
GlobalKTable is loaded before hand in each running instance .


Join

For the KStream-KStream join, is depend on the timestamps of the record if they join or not. 
details: https://www.confluent.io/blog/crossing-streams-joins-apache-kafka/


Inner Kstream-KStream join       Windowed : gives data from left and right if key is presnt in both and with in specified window.
Left  Kstream-KStream join       left joins on right , all left data if right not present null is set ,
							     if right got the key which is already in left 
outer Kstream-KStream join       windowed  all the data from left and right and if not in window add null to right or left

Inner KTable-KTable join 	     Matched Data in both table	
Left  KTable-KTable join 	     Data in left table if not matched right set to null + common data 
							     if left gets data and not matched in right right sets to null ,
							     if right gets data and not matched in left do nothing	
outer KTable-KTable join         Data from both tables not matched set left or right to null .
								

Inner Kstream-KTable join        if stream gets data : if key is present table it will match and store in result stream
							     if table gets data : ignored till stream gets 	
Left Kstream-KTable join 		 All the data from stream if not present in table set to null

Inner Kstream-GlobalKTable join  GlobalKtable is loaded before hand  All the data common to both Stream and GlobalKTable
									
Left Kstream-GlobalKTable join   All the data from Left if not present at that time in GlobalKtable Set right will set to null.

Cassandra :

Why cassandra need all the partition key columns in where clause ?
Why Allow filtering is required in some queries ? https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/allow-filtering-explained-2
Why should you use token function ? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39839133/understanding-the-token-function-in-cassandra
How to achive pagination in cassandra ?
Why it is necessary to present the clustering column in order ?
Which of the following is invalid query ? Why ?

1)	SELECT * FROM numberOfRequests
    WHERE cluster = ‘cluster1’
    AND date = ‘2015-06-05’
    AND datacenter = 'US_WEST_COAST'
    AND hour= 12
    AND minute >= 0 AND minute <= 30;
2)  SELECT * FROM numberOfRequests
    WHERE cluster = ‘cluster1’
    AND date = ‘2015-06-05’
    AND datacenter > 'US';
3) 	SELECT * FROM numberOfRequests
    WHERE cluster = ‘cluster1’
    AND date = ‘2015-06-05’
    AND datacenter = 'US_WEST_COAST'
    AND hour >= 12 AND minute = 0;
What all restictons are there in where clause ?
What is Data modeling ?
	Analyze requirement 
	Identify entities and relationships
	Identity queries
	Identity keyspaces,tabel 
	Identify the type of columns
	
How to data model ?
Queries are the king of data modeling ? 
Diffrence between the RDBMS and cassandra data modeling ?
      RDBMS                        Cassandra
Data->Model->Application	Application->Model->Data
Entities are king			Queries are king 
Primary key uniqueness      Primary keys used as partition keys
ACID						CAP theorem
Joins and indexes 			Denormalization



What is ACID Transaction?
Atomic     : commit and rollback
Consistent : Data should be in consistent state after transaction 
Isolate    : Transaction do not interfere with each other
Durable	   : Completed transaction persist	

Cassandra supports ACD for writes to individual rows
What is Tunnable Consistency ?
Cassandra is AP database .
Cassandra does not supports joins , so Denormalize as mush as you can . But don`t over do it .
What is referential integrity ?

What is clustering column?
What is consistent hashing?
What is simple primary key ?
How the fetch and store in multi value partition key works ?
What is the diffrence between PRIMARY KEY((id)) and PRIMARY KEY((year),title)?
Clustering column is used for sorting ? Default is acsending . You can specify the descending.
How to make the table dec ? ORDER BY (DESC)
You always should use partition key in Where clause .
you can use range query on clustering column .
The order of keys should be preserved ?

What are the UDTs ?
Why we shoul use UDTs ?
What are the counters ? Where it can be used ?
Can you insert in counter columns ? no
What is the defalut value of counter columns ? 0
How many counter columns are possible in table ? 1
Counters cannot be indexed
