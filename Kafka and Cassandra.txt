What is topic ?
How data in a stored in topic ?
What is log in kafka?
Explain the kafka as messaging system ?
What is log compaction ?
	ensures that log contains at least the last known value of for specific key 
	If you want to get database like feature not stream
	All the current consumer don`t get to see the updated results ,
	All the new comsuers will see only on key 
	Does not change offset 
	Deleted records can be seen by consumer delete.retention.ms default 24

Cassandra :

Why cassandra need all the partition key columns in where clause ?
Why Allow filtering is required in some queries ? https://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/allow-filtering-explained-2
Why should you use token function ? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39839133/understanding-the-token-function-in-cassandra
How to achive pagination in cassandra ?
Why it is necessary to present the clustering column in order ?
Which of the following is invalid query ? Why ?

1)	SELECT * FROM numberOfRequests
    WHERE cluster = ‘cluster1’
    AND date = ‘2015-06-05’
    AND datacenter = 'US_WEST_COAST'
    AND hour= 12
    AND minute >= 0 AND minute <= 30;
2)  SELECT * FROM numberOfRequests
    WHERE cluster = ‘cluster1’
    AND date = ‘2015-06-05’
    AND datacenter > 'US';
3) 	SELECT * FROM numberOfRequests
    WHERE cluster = ‘cluster1’
    AND date = ‘2015-06-05’
    AND datacenter = 'US_WEST_COAST'
    AND hour >= 12 AND minute = 0;
What all restictons are there in where clause ?
What is Data modeling ?
	Analyze requirement 
	Identify entities and relationships
	Identity queries
	Identity keyspaces,tabel 
	Identify the type of columns
	
How to data model ?
Queries are the king of data modeling ? 
Diffrence between the RDBMS and cassandra data modeling ?
      RDBMS                        Cassandra
Data->Model->Application	Application->Model->Data
Entities are king			Queries are king 
Primary key uniqueness      Primary keys used as partition keys
ACID						CAP theorem
Joins and indexes 			Denormalization



What is ACID Transaction?
Atomic     : commit and rollback
Consistent : Data should be in consistent state after transaction 
Isolate    : Transaction do not interfere with each other
Durable	   : Completed transaction persist	

Cassandra supports ACD for writes to individual rows
What is Tunnable Consistency ?
Cassandra is AP database .
Cassandra does not supports joins , so Denormalize as mush as you can . But don`t over do it .
What is referential integrity ?
What is keyspace ?
What is class in keyspace ?
What is COPY command ?
how to generate uuid and current timeuuid  ?
uuid() and timeuuid ()
How to import CSVs into table ?
How to delete all rows from table ? truncate table1;
How truncate command works ?
What if one of the nodes are down whrn you hit truncate command ?
What if you drop the column which is part of primary key ?
Can you execute the more than one cql at once ? Use SOURCE './script.cql'
What is data model ? way of organizing data 
What is key space ? tables will be in keysapce 
What is primary key ? primary key also contains clustering columns
What is Partition key ?
What is clustering column?
What is consistent hashing?
What is simple primary key ?
How the fetch and store in multi value partition key works ?
What is the diffrence between PRIMARY KEY((id)) and PRIMARY KEY((year),title)?
Clustering column is used for sorting ? Default is acsending . You can specify the descending.
How to make the table dec ? ORDER BY (DESC)
You always should use partition key in Where clause .
you can use range query on clustering column .
The order of keys should be preserved ?
What are the collections available in cassandra ?
What are the UDTs ?
Why we shoul use UDTs ?
What are the counters ? Where it can be used ?
Can you insert in counter columns ? no
What is the defalut value of counter columns ? 0
How many counter columns are possible in table ? 1
Counters cannot be indexed

What are user defined Function ?          needs a lot of practice 
What are user defined aggregates ?        needs a lot of practice
