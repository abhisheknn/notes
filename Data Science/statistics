What is Statistics ?  
Statistics is the study and manipulation of data, including ways to gather, review, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.  


What is Population (N) ?  Whole Data set.   
What is Sample (n) ? part of Data set     
What is the Theme ?   
What is Population Parmameter ?  
What is Sample Statistics ?  
What is Individuals ? individual in Data set. 
What is Variable ? Characteristics/properties of individual in Dataset. 


What is Discriptive Statistics ?  
What is Inferential Statistics ?

Levels of measurement ?  
Quantitive and Qualitative data.

Sampling: way of deciding the indivduals 

Why we need sample :
part of the population 
infrential statistics 
Cannot measure the whole population becaue its impractical

Sampling frame :
list of individual from which sample is collected 
prat of the population from which you have to draw the population from 

Undercoverage :
ommiting some individuals from sampling frame 

Samping Error :
population mean is diffrent than sample mean 
population % will be diffent that sample %

Non Sampling Errors:
bad list
sloppy data collection 

Simulation :
Representation of real world pheomenon


Types of sampling : 
1) Simple Random Sampling
-Subest of population selected from the sample have equal chance iof getting selected
-in the popualtion of 100 if we take sample of 5 student based on some charactistics 
-similar sample group will be picked each time .

Method:
-Assign unique no to individual 
-Randomaly select the one from the list 

limits: 
-partial list 
-invalid list 

2) Stratified Random Sampling 
-list is divided in groups 
-divide by layers
-divide the population in subgroup based on same characteristics 
-then run SRS on stratum
limit:
-oversampling
-need a list before hand

3) Systematic Sampling
-Array of individuals in any order
-start at random point
-take the kth individual, repeat
limit : 
-What is peroridicity is there ?

4) Cluster Sampling  
-Geographic
-map is devided
-Baised
limit :
-same geographic area have same type of people  

5) Convenince Sampling ;
 -low risk circumstances
 -good for studies like which ice cream is best
 -raidily available data 
limit :
 -bias in every group
 -miss important population

6) Multistage Sampling 
-include any of above smapling techniqueue multipletimes

ex:
cluster-> SRS -> Startified -> Startified -> SRS 


Guideline for planing a statistical Study :
-state the hypothesis 
-Identify the individual of interest
-Specify the variable to measure 
-determine population or sample 
-if Sample -> choose sampling method
-Ethical concerns
-collect data
-use descriptive or infrential statistics to answer your hypothesis
-Note your observations/concerns about your data collection or analysis
-Make recommendation for future studies 

Census : whole population 
Sample : PArt of Population 

Experiment Vs Observational Study 

Experiment : 
Some treatment/ intevation (Asked to do something) , Exeperiment on individual Variable 

Observation:
no Experiment , just obsrvation of variable .

Replication :
Studies must be done properly so anyone can replicted .

Avoiding Bias in Survery Design 
- minimize bias

Non Response and Voluntary Response

Truthfulness of Response
-recall Bias : people will forget after sometime 
-too personal /awkward ques

Hidden Bias
-Question wording may including certain reponse 
-Order of question
-Scales of question may not accurately meausre response 

Influnce of Interview 
Vague wording 

Lurking Variable 
-varible thatis associated with a condition but may not cause that condition 
 Ex: people with the tattoo more likely to meet with accident
- people with same intelligence and education level deos not make same amout of money 
lurking variable : Sex , Race 

Randomization :
- is used to assign individual to treatment group 
- A completely Randomize Experience

Placebo Effect
-Contol Group 

Blocked Randomization 
-Group the individual in block 
-then add intervention with in group 

Blinding :
individual should not know in which group he blongs to 

Double Binding :
Both Staff and participant do not know about treatment assignment .
