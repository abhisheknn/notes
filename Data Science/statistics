What is Statistics ?  
Statistics is the study and manipulation of data, including ways to gather, review, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.  


What is Population (N) ?  Whole Data set.   
What is Sample (n) ? part of Data set

Sampling: way of deciding the indivduals 

Why we need sample :
part of the population 
infrential statistics 
Cannot measure the whole population becaue its impractical

Sampling frame :
list of individual from which sample is collected 
prat of the population from which you have to draw the population from 

Undercoverage :
ommiting some individuals from sampling frame 

Samping Error :
population mean is diffrent than sample mean 
population % will be diffent that sample %

Non Sampling Errors:
bad list
sloppy data collection 

Simulation :
Representation of real world pheomenon


Types of sampling : 
1) Simple Random Sampling
-Subest of population selected from the sample have equal chance iof getting selected
-in the popualtion of 100 if we take sample of 5 student based on some charactistics 
-similar sample group will be picked each time .

Method:
-Assign unique no to individual 
-Randomaly select the one from the list 

limits: 
-partial list 
-invalid list 

2) Stratified Random Sampling 
-list is divided in groups 
-divide by layers
-divide the population in subgroup based on same characteristics 
-then run SRS on stratum
limit:
-oversampling
-need a list before hand

3) Systematic Sampling
-Array of individuals in any order
-start at random point
-take the kth individual, repeat
limit : 
-What is peroridicity is there ?

4) Cluster Sampling  
-Geographic
-map is devided
-Baised
limit :
-same geographic area have same type of people  

5) Convenince Sampling ;
 -low risk circumstances
 -good for studies like which ice cream is best
 -raidily available data 
limit :
 -bias in every group
 -miss important population

6) Multistage Sampling 
-include any of above smapling techniqueue multipletimes

ex:
cluster-> SRS -> Startified -> Startified -> SRS
